### Hi there 👋

My name is Henry, and I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto. 

- ⚙️ Previously I was at [Cerebras Systems](https://cerebras.net) as a **Machine Learning Frameworks Software Engineer Intern**, where I worked on integrating [PyTorch](http://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/) with the [Cerebras CS-2 System](https://www.cerebras.net/product-system/) — the world's fastest AI accelerator.

- 🛠️ At Cerebras, I made significant contributions to open-source projects, such as [Torch-MLIR](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir) (supported by the LLVM Project and Google), and [PyTorch](http://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/). I primarily worked on creating the Lazy Tensor Core frontend for Torch-MLIR (read more about it [here](https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir/blob/main/docs/ltc_backend.md)).

- 💻 I'm currently serving as a Board Member for [Hack the 6ix](https://hackthe6ix.com) — Toronto's largest summer hackathon. Prior to that, I coordinated **27 organizers** as Co-Chair of our 2021 event, which had **670+ attendees**. I also built robust web infrastructure to handle 4500+ users across multiple events as Web Director.

- 🤖 I've also worked on a number of hardware/robotics related projects in the past (lots of Raspberry Pi + 3D printing), and enjoy creating working on IoT related projects.

- 👔 I'm looking for SWE internship opportunities for **Summer 2023**! Please contact me if you would like to learn more about me 🙂.
